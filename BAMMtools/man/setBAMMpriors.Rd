\usage{
setBAMMpriors(

  total.taxa = NULL,
  traits = NULL,
  outfile = "myPriors.txt",
  Nmax = 1000,
  suppressWarning = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{An object of class \code{phylo}, e.g., the phylogenetic tree
you will analyze with \code{BAMM}.}

\item{total.taxa}{If doing speciation-extinction analysis, the total
number of taxa in your clade. If your tree contains all taxa in the
clade (100\% sampling), then leave this as \code{NULL}.}

\item{traits}{A filename where the trait data (\code{BAMM} format) are
stored, or a numeric vector named according to the tips in \code{phy}.
Leave \code{NULL} if doing a speciation-extinction analysis.}

\item{outfile}{Filename for outputting the sample priors block. If
\code{NULL}, then a vector is returned instead.}

\item{Nmax}{If analyzing a very large tree for phenotypic evolution, uses
only this many taxa to estimate priors for your dataset. Avoid matrix
inversion issues with large numbers of tips.}

\item{suppressWarning}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the warning about
setting the Poisson rate prior is suppressed. Only applies if
\code{outfile = NULL}.}
}
\value{
The function does not return anything. It simply performs some
    calculations and writes formatted output to a file. However, if
    \code{outfile = NULL}, then a named vector is returned.

Set priors for \code{BAMM} analysis.

\details{
This is a "quick and dirty" tool for identifying approximately
    acceptable priors for a \code{BAMM} analysis. We have found that
    choice of prior can have a substantial impact on \code{BAMM} analyses.
    It is difficult to simply set a default prior that applies across
    datasets, because users often have trees with branch lengths in very
    different units (e.g., numbers of substitutions versus millions of
    years). Hence, without some careful attention, you can inadvertently
    specify some very bad prior distributions. This function is designed
    to at least put you in the right ballpark for decent prior
    distributions, but there are no guarantees that these are most
    appropriate for your data.

    The general rules applied here are: 

    For the \code{lambdaInitPrior}, we estimate the speciation rate of the
    data under a pure birth model. We then set this prior to give an
    exponential distribution with a mean five times greater than this
    computed pure birth speciation estimate.

    The \code{lambdaShiftPrior} is the standard deviation of the normal
    prior on the exponential change parameter k. We set the prior
    distribution based on the age of the root of the tree. We set the
    standard deviation of this distribution such that 2 standard
    deviations give a parameter that will yield a 90\% decline in the
    initial speciation rate between the root of the tree and the tips.
    The basic model is lambda(t) = lambda_0 * exp(k * t). This is a
    straightforward calculation: let x = -log(0.1) / TMAX, where TMAX is
    the age of the tree. Then set the standard deviation equal to (x / 2).

    We set \code{muInitPrior} equal to \code{lambdaInitPrior}.  

    For trait evolution, we first compute the maximum likelihood estimate
    of the variance of a Brownian motion process of trait evolution. The
    prior \code{betaInitPrior} is then set to an exponential distribution
    with a mean 5 times greater than this value (similar to what is done
    for lambda and mu, above).  

    This function generates an output file containing a prior parameters
    block that can be pasted directly into the priors section of your
    \code{BAMM} control file.
