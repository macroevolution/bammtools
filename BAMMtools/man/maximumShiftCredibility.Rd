\title{Estimate maximum shift credibility configuration}
\usage{
maximumShiftCredibility(ephy, maximize = "product")
}
\arguments{
\item{ephy}{An object of class \code{BAMMdata}.}

\item{maximize}{Maximize the marginal probability of the product or sum of
branch-specific shifts.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
    \itemize{
        \item bestconfigs: A vector of the index values of MCMC samples
            with shift configurations equal to the maximum. Usually, more
            than one state sampled during the MCMC simulation will have an
            identical (maximized) marginal probability. All samples given
            in this vector will have an identical shift configuration.
        \item scores: The optimality score (product or sum of marginal
            shift probabilities) for all sampled shift configurations in
            the \code{BAMMdata} object.
        \item optimalityType: Whether the product or sum of marginal
            shift probabilities was used to compute the maximum shift
            credibility configuration.
        \item sampleindex: A representative sample that is equal to the
            maximum shift credibility configuration (e.g., this can be
            plotted with \code{\link{addBAMMshifts}}).
    }

\description{
This is one estimate of the "best" rate shift configuration,
    considering only those shift configurations that were actually sampled
    using \code{BAMM}'s reversible jump MCMC simulator. This is analogous
    to the "maximum clade credibility tree" from a Bayesian phylogenetic
    analysis. It is not necessarily the same as the shift configuration
    with the maximum a posteriori probability.
}
\details{
This is one point estimate of the overall "best" rate shift
    configuration. Following an MCMC simulation, the marginal shift
    probabilities on each individual branch are computed using
    \code{\link{marginalShiftProbsTree}}. The shift configuration that
    maximizes the product (or sum, if specified) of these marginal
    branch-specific shift probabilities is the \emph{maximum shift
    credibility configuration}.  

    This option is only recommended if you have no clear "winner" in your
    credible set of shift configurations (see
    \code{\link{credibleShiftSet}}). If you have a number of
    largely-equiprobable shift configurations in your 95\% credible set,
    you may wish to try this function as an alternative for identifying a
    single best shift configuration. Otherwise, it is recommended that you
    present the shift configuration with the maximum a posteriori
    probability (see \code{\link{getBestShiftConfiguration}}).
