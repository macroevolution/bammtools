    \item{downseq} {An integer vector holding the nodes of \code{phy}. The
        order corresponds to the order in which nodes are visited by a
        pre-order tree traversal.}
    \item{lastvisit} {An integer vector giving the index of the last node
        visited by the node in the corresponding position in
        \code{downseq}. \code{downseq} and \code{lastvisit} can be used to
        quickly retrieve the descendants of any node. e.g. the descendants
        of node 89 can be found by
        \code{downseq[which(downseq==89):which(downseq==lastvisit[89])}.}

\description{
\code{getEventData} Reads shift configuration data (the
    "event data" output) from a \code{BAMM} analysis and creates a
    \code{bammdata} object. The \code{bammdata} object is fundamental
    for extracting information about macroevolutionary rate variation
    through time and among lineages.
}
\details{
In the \code{BAMM} framework, an "event" defines a
    macroevolutionary process of diversification or trait evolution. Every
    sample from the posterior includes at least one process, defined by
    such an "event". If a given sample includes just a single event, then
    the dynamics of diversification or trait evolution can be described
    entirely by a single time-constant or time-varying process that begins
    at the root of the tree. Any sample from the posterior distribution
    may include a complex mixture of distinct processes. To represent
    temporal heterogeneity in macroevolutionary rates, \code{BAMM} models
    a rate \eqn{R}, e.g. speciation, as a function that changes
    exponentially with time:

    \eqn{R(t) = R(0)*exp(b*t)}.

    Here \eqn{R(0)} is the initial rate and \eqn{b} is a parameter
    determining how quickly that rate grows or decays with time. 

    The \code{eventdata} file (or data frame) is a record of events and
    associated parameters that were sampled with \code{BAMM} during
    simulation of the posterior with reversible jump MCMC. This complex,
    information-rich file is processed into a \code{bammdata} object,
    which serves as the core data object for numerous downstream analyses.
    From a \code{bammdata} object, you can summarize rate variation
    through time, among clades, extract locations of rate shifts,
    summarize clade-specific rates of speciation and extinction, and more.

    In general, the user does not need to be concerned with the details of
    a \code{bammdata} object. The object is used as input by a number of
    \code{BAMMtools} functions. 

    The parameter \code{nsamples} can be used to reduce the total amount
    of data included in the raw eventdata output from a \code{BAMM} run.
    The final \code{bammdata} object will consist of all data for
    \code{nsamples} from the posterior. These \code{nsamples} are equally
    spaced after discarding some \code{burnin} fraction as "burn-in". If
    \code{nsamples} is set to \code{NULL}, the \code{bammdata} object will
    include all samples in the posterior after discarding the
    \code{burnin} fraction.
}
\note{
Currently the function does not check for duplicate tip labels in
    \code{phy}, which may cause the function to choke.
