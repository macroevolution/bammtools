\item{ephy}{An object of class \code{bammdata}.}

\item{expectedNumberOfShifts}{The expected number of rate shifts under the
prior.}

\item{threshold}{The marginal posterior-to-prior odds ratio for a rate
shift on a specific branch, used to distinguish core and non-core
shifts.}

}
\value{
A class \code{credibleshiftset} object with many components. Most
    components are an ordered list of length L, where L is the number of
    distinct shift configurations in the credible set. The first list
    element in each case corresponds to the shift configuration with the
    maximum a posteriori probability. 

    \item{frequency}{A vector of frequencies of shift configurations,
        including those that account for \code{set.limit} (typically, 0.95
        or 0.99) of the probability of the data. The index of the i'th
        element of this vector is the i'th most probable shift
        configuration (excepting ties).}
    \item{shiftnodes}{A list of the "core" rate shifts (marginal
        probability > threshold) that occurred in each distinct shift
        configuration in the credible set. The i'th vector from this list
        gives the core shift nodes for the i'th shift configuration. They
        are sorted by frequency, so \code{x$shiftnodes[[1]]} gives the
        shift nodes that occurred together in the shift configuration with
        the highest posterior probability.}
    \item{indices}{A list of vectors containing the indices of samples in
        the \code{bammdata} object that are assigned to a given shift
        configuration. All are sorted by frequency.}
    \item{cumulative}{Like \code{frequency}, but contains the cumulative
        frequencies.}
    \item{threshold}{The marginal posterior-to-prior odds for rate shifts
        on branches used during enumeration of distinct shift
        configurations.}
    \item{number.distinct}{Number of distinct shift configurations in the
        credible set.}
    \item{set.limit}{which credible set is this (0.9, 0.95, etc)?}
    \item{coreshifts}{A vector of node numbers corresponding to the core
        shifts. All of these nodes have a Bayes factor of at least
        \code{BFcriterion} supporting a rate shift.}

    In addition, a number of components that are defined similarly in
    class \code{phylo} or class \code{bammdata} objects:

    \item{edge}{See documentation for class \code{phylo} in package ape.}
    \item{Nnode}{See documentation for class \code{phylo} in package ape.}
    \item{tip.label}{See documentation for class \code{phylo} in package
        ape.}
    \item{edge.length}{See documentation for class \code{phylo} in package
        ape.}
    \item{begin}{The beginning time of each branch in absolute time (the
        root is set to time zero)}
    \item{end}{The ending time of each branch in absolute time.}
    \item{numberEvents}{An integer vector with the number of core events
        contained in the \code{bammdata} object for each shift
        configuration in the credible set. The length of this vector is
        equal to the number of distinct shift configurations in the
        credible set.}
    \item{eventData}{A list of dataframes. Each element holds the average
        rate and location parameters for all samples from the posterior
        that were assigned to a particular distinct shift configuration.
        Each row in a dataframe holds the data for a single event. Data
        associated with an event are: \code{node} - a node number. This
        identifies the branch where the event originates. \code{time} -
        this is the absolute time on that branch where the event
        originates (with the root at time 0). \code{lam1} - an initial
        rate of speciation or trait evolution.\code{lam2} - a decay/growth
        parameter. \code{mu1} - an initial rate of extinction. \code{mu2}
        - a decay/growth parameter. \code{index} - a unique integer
        associated with the event. See 'Details' in the documentation for
        \code{\link{getEventData}} for more information.}
    \item{eventVectors}{A list of integer vectors. Each element is for a
        single shift configuration in the posterior. For each branch in
        the \code{bammdata} object, gives the index of the event governing
        the (tipwards) end of the branch. Branches are ordered increasing
        here and elsewhere.}
    \item{eventBranchSegs}{A list of matrices. Each element of the list is
        a single distinct shift configuration. Each matrix has four
        columns: \code{Column 1} identifies a node in \code{phy}.
        \code{Column 2} identifies the beginning time of the branch or
        segment of the branch that subtends the node in \code{Column 1}.
        \code{Column 3} identifies the ending time of the branch or
        segment of the branch that subtends the node in \code{Column 1}.
        \code{Column 4} identifies the index of the event that occurs
        along the branch or segment of the branch that subtends the node
        in \code{Column 1}.}
    \item{tipStates}{A list of integer vectors. Each element is a single
        distinct shift configuration. For each tip the index of the event
        that occurs along the branch subtending the tip. Tips are ordered
        increasing here and elsewhere.}
    \item{tipLambda}{A list of numeric vectors. Each element is a single
        distinct shift configuration. For each tip is the average rate of
        speciation or trait evolution at the end of the terminal branch
        subtending that tip (averaged over all samples that are assignable
        to this particular distinct shift configuration).}
    \item{tipMu}{A list of numeric vectors. Each element is a single
        distinct shift configuration. For each tip the rate of extinction
        at the end of the terminal branch subtending that tip. Meaningless
        if working with \code{BAMM} trait results.}
    \item{type}{A character string. Either "diversification" or "trait"
        depending on your \code{BAMM} analysis.}
    \item{downseq}{An integer vector holding the nodes of \code{phy}. The
        order corresponds to the order in which nodes are visited by a
        pre-order tree traversal.}
    \item{lastvisit}{An integer vector giving the index of the last node
        visited by the node in the corresponding position in
        \code{downseq}. \code{downseq} and \code{lastvisit} can be used to
        quickly retrieve the descendants of any node. e.g. the descendants
        of node 89 can be found by
        \code{downseq[which(downseq==89):which(downseq==lastvisit[89])}.}

\description{
Computes the 95\% (or any other \%) credible set of
    macroevolutionary rate shift configurations from a \code{bammdata}
    object. These results can be analyzed further and/or plotted.
}
\details{
Computes the 95\% credible set (or XX\% credible set, depending
    on \code{set.limit}) of diversification shift configurations sampled
    using \code{BAMM}. This is analogous to a credible set of phylogenetic
    tree topologies from a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. 

    To understand how this calculation is performed, one must first
    distinguish between "core" and "non-core" rate shifts. A "core shift"
    is a rate shift with a marginal probability that is substantially
    elevated above the probability expected on the basis of the prior
    alone. With \code{BAMM}, every branch in a phylogenetic tree is
    associated with some non-zero prior probability of a rate shift.
    Typically this is a very low per-branch shift probability (this prior
    is determined by the value of the "poissonRatePrior" parameter in a
    \code{BAMM} analysis). 

    If we compute distinct shift configurations with every sampled shift
    (including those shifts with very low marginal probabilities), the
    number of distinct shift configurations will be overwhelmingly high.
    However, most of these configurations include shifts with marginal
    probabilities that are expected even under the prior alone. Hence,
    using these shifts to identify distinct shift configurations simply
    generates noise and isn't particularly useful.

    The solution adopted in \code{BAMMtools} is, for each branch in the
    phylogeny, to compute both the posterior and prior probabilities of a
    rate shift occurring. The ratio of these probabilities is a
    branch-specific marginal odds ratio: it is the marginal posterior
    frequency of one or more rate shifts normalized by the corresponding
    prior probability. Hence, any branch with a marginal odds ratio of
    1.0 is one where the observed (posterior) odds of a rate shift are no
    different from the prior odds. A value of 10 implies that the
    posterior probability is 10 times the prior probability. 

    The user of \code{credibleShiftSet} must specify a \code{threshold}
    argument. This is simply a cutoff value for identifying "important"
    shifts for the purposes of identifying distinct shift configurations.
    This does not imply that it is identifying "significant" shifts. See
    the online documentation on this topic available at
    \url{http://bamm-project.org} for more information. If you specify
    \code{threshold = 5} as an argument to \code{credibleShiftSet}, the
    function will ignore all branches with marginal odds ratios less than
    5 during the enumeration of topologically distinct shift
    configurations. Only shifts with marginal odds ratios greater than or
    equal to \code{threshold} will be treated as core shifts for the
    purposes of identifying distinct shift configurations.

    For each shift configuration in the credible set, this function will
    compute the average diversification parameters. For example, the most
    frequent shift configuration (the maximum a posteriori shift
    configuration) might have 3 shifts, and 150 samples from your
    posterior (within the \code{bammdata} object) might show this shift
    configuration. However, the parameters associated with each of these
    shift configurations (the actual evolutionary rate parameters) might
    be different for every sample. This function returns the mean set of
    rate parameters for each shift configuration, averaging over all
    samples from the posterior that can be assigned to a particular shift
    configuration.
