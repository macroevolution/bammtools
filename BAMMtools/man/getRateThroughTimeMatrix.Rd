getRateThroughTimeMatrix(
  ephy,
  start.time = NULL,
  end.time = NULL,
  nslices = 100,
  node = NULL,
  nodetype = "include"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ephy}{An object of class \code{bammdata}.}

\item{start.time}{The start time (in units before present) for the time.
sequence over which rates should be computed. If \code{NULL}, starts
at the root.}

\item{end.time}{The end time (in units before present) for the time
sequence over which rates should be computed. If \code{NULL}, ends in
the present.}

\item{nslices}{The number of time points at which to compute rate
estimates (between \code{start.time} and \code{end.time}).}

\item{node}{Allows user to extract rate-through-time information for the
subtree descended from a specific node. Alternatively, a specified
subtree can be excluded from the rate matrix calculations.}

\item{nodetype}{Two options: "include" and "exclude". If "include",
computes rate matrix only for the descendants of subtree defined by
\code{node}. If "exclude", computes rate matrix for all background
lineages in tree after excluding the subtree defined by \code{node}.
Ignored if \code{node = NULL}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bamm-ratematrix} with the following
    components:

    \item{lambda}{A \code{nsamples} x \code{nslices} matrix of speciation
        rates, where \code{nsamples} is the number of posterior samples in
        the \code{bammdata} object.}
    \item{mu}{A \code{nsamples} x \code{nslices} matrix of extinction
        rates.}
    \item{beta}{A \code{nsamples} x \code{nslices} matrix of phenotypic
        rates (if applicable).}
    \item{times}{A vector of timepoints where rates were computed.}
    \item{times}{A vector of timepoints where rates were computed (see
        Examples).}
    \item{type}{Either "diversification" or "trait", depending on the
        input data.}
}
\description{
Computes a matrix of macroevolutionary rates at specified
    timepoints from a \code{bammdata} object. These rates can be used for
    plotting speciation rates (and other rates) through time.
}
\details{
Computes evolutionary rates for each sample in the posterior
    included as part of the \code{bammdata} object. Rates are computed by
    draping an imaginary grid over the phylogeny, where the grid begins at
    \code{start.time} and ends at \code{end.time}, with \code{nslices}
    vertical lines through the phylogeny. The mean rate at each point in
    time (for a given sample from the posterior) is simply the mean rate
    at that time for all branches that are intersected by the grid (see
    the grid plot in the examples section).

    This function is used by \link{plotRateThroughTime}, but the user can
    work directly with the \code{bamm-ratematrix} object for greater
    control in plotting rate-through-time trajectories for individual
    clades. See \code{examples} for an example of how this can be used to
    plot confidence intervals on a rate trajectory using shaded polygons.

    The \code{node} options are particularly useful. If you have run
    \code{BAMM} on a large phylogeny, you can easily generate the
    rate-through-time data for a particular subtree by specifying the node
    number along with \code{nodetype = "include"}. Likewise, if you want
    to look at just the background rate - excluding some particular
    lineage - just specify \code{nodetype = "exclude"}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Plot a rate-through-time curve with 
# confidence intervals for the whale dataset:

data(whales, events.whales)
ed <- getEventData(whales, events.whales)

rmat <- getRateThroughTimeMatrix(ed)

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim=c(0, 36), ylim=c(0, .7))

## Speciation quantiles: plot 90\% CIs
qq <- apply(rmat$lambda, 2, quantile, c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95))

xv <- c(rmat$times, rev(rmat$times))
yv <- c(qq[1,], rev(qq[3,]))

## Add the confidence polygon on rate distributions:
polygon(xv, yv, col='gray80', border=FALSE)

## Add the median rate line:
lines(rmat$times, qq[2,], lwd=3, col='red')

## Add axes
axis(1, at=seq(-5, 35, by=5))
axis(2, at=seq(-0.2, 1, by=0.2), las=1)

####### Now we will show the actual grid used for rate calculations:

plot(whales, show.tip.label=FALSE)
axisPhylo()

mbt <- max(branching.times(whales))
tvec <- mbt - rmat$times;
tvec <- rmat$times;

for (i in 1:length(tvec)){
    lines(x=c(tvec[i], tvec[i]), y=c(0, 90), lwd=0.7, col='gray70')
}

## This shows the grid of time slices over the phylogeny}
