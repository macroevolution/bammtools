\title{Identify distinct rate shift configurations}
\usage{
distinctShiftConfigurations(ephy, expectedNumberOfShifts, threshold, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ephy}{An object of class \code{bammdata}.}

\item{expectedNumberOfShifts}{The expected number of rate shifts under the
prior.}

\item{threshold}{Threshold value for marginal posterior-to-prior odds
ratios, used to identify branches with elevated shift probabilities
relative to prior (core vs non-core shifts).}

\item{\dots}{Other arguments to distinctShiftConfigurations (possibly
deprecated args).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bammshifts}. This is a list with the
    following components:
    \itemize{
        \item marg.probs: A list of the marginal probability of a shift
            occurring at each node of the phylogeny for each distinct rate
            shift configuration.
        \item marginal_odd_ratio: Marginal posterior-to-prior odds ratios
            for one or more rate shifts an a given branch.
        \item shifts: A list of the set of shift nodes for each distinct
            rate configuration.
        \item samplesets: A list of sample indices that reduce to each of
            the unique shift sets.
        \item frequency: A vector of frequencies of each distinct shift
            configuration.
        \item coreshifts: A vector of node numbers corresponding to the
            core shifts. All of these nodes have a marginal odds ratio of
            at least \code{threshold} supporting a rate shift.
        \item threshold: A single numeric value giving the marginal
            posterior:prior odds ratio threshold used during enumeration
            of distinct shift configurations.
    }
    Results are sorted by frequency:

    $frequency[1] gives the most common shift configuration sampled.

    $shifts[[1]] gives the corresponding node indices for that
    configuration.

    $samplesets[[1]] gives the indices of samples with this configuration.

\description{
Identify topologically distinct rate shift configurations
    that were sampled with \code{BAMM}, and assign each sample in the
    posterior to one of the distinct shift configurations.
}
\details{
See Rabosky et al (2014) and the \code{BAMM} project website for
    details on the nature of distinct shift configurations and especially
    the distinction between "core" and "non-core" rate shifts. Note that
    branches with elevated marginal posterior probabilities relative to
    the prior (marginal odds ratios) cannot be claimed to have
    "significant" evidence for a rate shift on the basis of this evidence
    alone.
