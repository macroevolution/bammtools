\title{Compute prior odds of a rate shift on each branch of a phylogeny
    from BAMM output}
\usage{
getBranchShiftPriors(phy, expectedNumberOfShifts)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{An object of class \code{phylo}.}

\item{expectedNumberOfShifts}{The expected number of shifts under the
prior.}
}
\value{
A class \code{phylo} with all the components of the original class
    \code{phylo} object, with the following changes:

    \item{edge.length}{Branch lengths now represent the prior probability
    of a rate shift on each branch.}
}
\description{
Computes the prior probability of a rate shift event for each
    branch. These results are important for identifying topological rate
    shift locations on phylogenies with marginal probabilities that exceed
    those predicted under the prior alone.
}
\details{
This function computes the prior odds on the distribution of
    numbers of rate shift events per branch under the prior. It returns an
    object which is nothing more than a copy of the original phylogenetic
    tree but where each branch length has been replaced by the prior
    probability of a rate shift on each branch.

    The significance of this function is that it lets us explicitly
    determine which branches have shift probabilities that are elevated
    relative to the prior expectation.

\examples{
data(whales)
prior_tree1 <- getBranchShiftPriors(whales, expectedNumberOfShifts = 1)
prior_tree10 <- getBranchShiftPriors(whales, expectedNumberOfShifts = 10)
# plot prior expectations for branches based on these two counts:
plot(prior_tree1$edge.length ~ prior_tree10$edge.length, xlim=c(0,0.05),
     ylim=c(0,0.05), asp=1)
lines(x=c(0,1), y=c(0,1))
