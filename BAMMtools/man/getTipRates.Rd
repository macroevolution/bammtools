\title{Compute tip-specific macroevolutionary rates from \code{bammdata}
    object}
\usage{
getTipRates(ephy, returnNetDiv = FALSE, statistic = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{ephy}{An object of class \code{bammdata}.}

\item{returnNetDiv}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then net diversification
rates are returned, if \code{FALSE}, then both speciation and
extinction rates are returned. If \code{ephy} is of type \code{trait},
then this is ignored.}

\item{statistic}{Determines how the average tip rates should be
calculated. Can be either \code{mean} or \code{median}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following elements:

    If \code{ephy} type is 'diversification':
    \itemize{
        \item{lambda} {A matrix of tip speciation rates with species as
            rows, and posterior samples as columns.}
        \item{mu} {A matrix of tip extinction rates with species as rows,
            and posterior samples as columns.}
        \item{lambda.avg} {A vector of average tip speciation rates,
            averaged with mean or median, depending on selected option for
            \code{statistic}. The vector is named with species names.}
        \item{mu.avg} {A vector of average tip extinction rates, averaged
            with mean or median, depending on selected option for
            \code{statistic}. The vector is named with species names.}
    }

    If \code{ephy} type is 'diversification' and
    \code{returnNetDiv = TRUE}:
    \itemize{
        \item{netdiv} {A matrix of tip net diversification rates with
            species as rows, and posterior samples as columns.}

        \item{netdiv.avg} {A vector of average tip net diversification
            rates, averaged with mean or median, depending on selected
            option for \code{statistic}. The vector is named with species
            names.}
    }

    If \code{ephy} type is 'trait':
    \itemize{
        \item{beta} {A matrix of tip phenotypic rates with species as
            rows, and posterior samples as columns.}
        \item{beta.avg} {A vector of average tip phenotypic rates,
            averaged with mean or median, depending on selected option for
            \code{statistic}. The vector is named with species names.}
    }
}
\description{
Return speciation, extinction, net diversification, or
    Brownian motion trait rates for all species in the phylogeny from
    \code{BAMM} output.

\examples{
data(whales, events.whales)
ephy <- getEventData(whales, events.whales, burnin=0.25, nsamples = 500)

ndr <- getTipRates(ephy, returnNetDiv = TRUE,
                   statistic = 'median')$netdiv.avg

# Return mean species-specific speciation rates from all posterior 
# samples in the \code{bamm-data} object.
lam <- getTipRates(ephy, returnNetDiv = FALSE, statistic = 'mean')$lambda
